**1. The Challenging feeling**

If you like to feel challenged everyday and thats something that makes you go further then this is the right choice for you, here you would find exciting adventures to face.


**2. The knowledge is power**

As a software engineering you would have access to almost unlimited knowledge, learn coding is like to learn a new language, you can learn spanish, english or french and you would have access to all the information in the language you learn but coding is more than that because coding is an universal language as.

So imagine the access of knowledge you would have with an universal language also you learn something new with every problem you will find in this exciting adventure.
 
**3. It pays off to be humble**

In the beggining you would realize there is a lot you don't know but if you are humble and accept you need help is the first step for being humble, also remember even if you don't know too much try to share with other people who doesn't know what you know now also a good way to see how much you know is teaching to others but again being humble is very important, a lot of people will help you but if you don't help then other people won't help you when you need help is a little bit of karma.

**4. You learn to be patient**

During your adventure of coding will be multiple paths to choose, many times you will choice the wrong one and you would have to make U turn or even get lost and after multiple attempts you will finally get the right answer so remember the patience is a virtue.

**5. Being persistent**

The key for success is the persistence, althought there is multiple times where you would feel that you want to give up DON'T DO IT, the answer is closer than you think even when you get errors all the time and none of your code work, your persistence and and your willing to study deeply will make you achieve th master work so always have in mind:

**6. You work in almost any industry**

Software engineering aloows you to work in the area o areas you are most interested because you learn to work with computer applications and systems so i is just up to you which direction you will take, remember most of the industries use any kind of software so you will be able to put your skills for any kind of industry.

**8. Programming skill gives you value **

**10. Open doors**
