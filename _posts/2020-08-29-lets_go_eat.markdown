**The Beggining**

I started to think a great idea for my first CLI project so I decided to do a geocoding API so I searched for information I saw different ideas and from google resources and youtube videos as well as from the labs from previous weeks I wanted to create an app that the user would be able to see 10 places to go near to the user's location and then choose from 3 different nearest places, description and details available for each place to go while I was doing the project I realized I would need sinatra gems and its in that momment when I started to suspect there was something wrong...

**At the Middle**

While I was in slack I saw a classmate: Cat asking if someone anted to code at 11 pm so I said  sure why not, I talked to her, she said she was in an other cohort but for personal reazons she moved to this cohort so she saw my project and she noticed that it was too much and that I would have to do it more simple so I decided to do a cli project that the user can choose from 10 different japanese restaurant and get information from each restaurant and also with Cat and Andrews help I was able to do my project more dynamic and colorfull.

**At the End**

In the last week I create an awesome help with my friends help and I know that if you see it you would like it so pass by my github and take a look in my repository but you would need a google API to run it but you can see the different dynamic designs and if you read the code you will notice how this CLI was made with love.
